This blog application allows at least one user to create, update, delete, and read blog posts. There is an antuentication tool implemented such that only users which are authenticated are allowed to create, update, or delete posts. There is a registration and login form for the authentication.

## How to run: 
```
cd BlogApplication/ && npm install && cd angular-src/ && npm install && ng build && node ../app.js
```

###### Note: 
- Node version: v8.11.0
- NPM version: 5.8.0
- I used Linux Mint 18.04 for the creation of this application
